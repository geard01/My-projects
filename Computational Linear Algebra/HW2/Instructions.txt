The MATLAB code allows the user to modify the number k, which can be set to 10, 20, or 40. 
Additionally, the tolerance and maximum iterations for the inverse power method can be adjusted to control the stopping criteria and iteration limits. These parameters should be defined before running the script. 
Once the desired values are set, the script can be executed in MATLAB.
Every point requested in the homework is well defined in the code, and all the necessary plots we be visualized automatically.  
All function definitions are provided at the end of the code for better organization and modularity.
